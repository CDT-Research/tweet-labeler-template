# CDT Tweet Labeler

The CDT Tweet Labeler is a custom web tool built by the Center for Democracy & Technology (CDT) designed to manage multiple coders labeling the same set of tweets. CDT designed this tool specifically for the quantitative portion of the project, ["An Unrepresentative Democracy â€” How Disinformation and Online Abuse Hinder Women of Color Political Candidates in the United States"](https://cdt.org/insights/an-unrepresentative-democracy-how-disinformation-and-online-abuse-hinder-women-of-color-political-candidates-in-the-united-states/). However, researchers can easily adopt this tool with only a few modifications to work with their own custom tweet labeling scheme.

If you are interested in adopting this software for your own purposes and have any questions, please contact research@cdt.org. If you want to run the code as is, check out [this file](SETUP.md) for more information on how.
